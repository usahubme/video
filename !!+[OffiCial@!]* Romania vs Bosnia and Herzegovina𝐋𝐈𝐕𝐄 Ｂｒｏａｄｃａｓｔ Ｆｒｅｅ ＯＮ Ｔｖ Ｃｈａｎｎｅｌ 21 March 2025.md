Romania has the wind in its sails as it prepares to host Bosnia & Herzegovina in 2026 World Cup qualifying on Friday.
Romania is enjoying some rare form as it prepares to get the ball rolling in its 2026 World Cup qualification bid on Friday at home to a Bosnia & Herzegovina team that has given its troubles in the past. That being said, the two teams have traded trajectories in recent years, and the Tricolorii has taken over as a potential UEFA underdog to keep an eye on while the Dragons have seen their stock plummet. In fact, Sergej Barbarez faces the unenviable task of turning around the Bosnians’ fortunes after going 12 games without a win and losing now fewer than 10 of those.

The managerial merry-go-round continued for Bosnia & Herzegovina last year after Barbarez took over the team he scored 17 goals for as a player.

The 53-year-old former Borussia Dortmund and Hannover forward has struggled in his first coaching deployment, however, and earned just two points from a miserable campaign in the top flight of the UEFA Nations League.

That being said, a 1-1 draw at home to the Netherlands in their last outing at least showed some spirit on the team’s behalf, even if they still haven’t won a game since October 2023.

Meanwhile, Romania stretched its win streak to six straight matches after beating Cyprus 4-1 its last time out, marking the team’s best run of form in almost two decades.

Former Turkey and Shakhtar Donetsk coach Mircea Lucescu has his home nation operating in slick fashion since taking over the team in August 2024.

The Tricolours scored 18 goals and conceded just three to reach the second tier of the UEFA Nations League without dropping a point, hoping to carry that form into the World Cup.
