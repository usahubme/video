In a match slated for Friday, Novak Djokovic (No. 5 in rankings) will take on Rinky Hijikata (No. 86) in the Round of 64 at the Miami Open presented by Itau.

Hijikata earned a three-set win over Hamad Medjedovic (7-5, 3-6, 7-5) in the Round of 128 in his most recent match on Wednesday. Djokovic lost his most recent match on March 8, 2025 in the Round of 64 at the BNP Paribas Open to Botic Van de Zandschulp 2-6, 6-3, 1-6.

Where to Watch

The winner of this match will play either No. 32 seed Alex Michelsen or Camilo Ugo Carabelli. Djokovic is looking to snap a three-match losing streak, his longest since 2018.

Miami Open Match Preview
Since the Australian Open, Djokovic has played two matches—against Matteo Berrettini and Botic Van de Zandschulp—and lost them both. With his 38th birthday, and two months of dirt-ball, on the horizon, he could use a win in Miami to stabilize his season. At this stage, Djokovic probably can’t afford to look past any opponent, including this one.

Still, there are worse people he could be facing. Hijikata is a 24-year-old Australian who played at the University of North Carolina. He’s ranked 86th and is 4-7 on the season. One of those seven losses came at the hands of Djokovic, 6-3, 6-3 in Brisbane in January.

Hijikata, slightly undersized at 5-foot-10, plays a familiar baseline game with one minor twist: While he can drive a two-handed backhand, he also likes to drop one hand off and go to a slice. He tried to disrupt Djokovic’s rhythm in Brisbane by floating that slice down the middle, then stepping around and upping the speed on his forehand. It’s a decent idea, but Djokovic handled it.

In Indian Wells, Djokovic wasn’t his traditionally clinical self. Instead of locking down his game when it mattered, he played his loosest tennis and became more error-prone. He’ll have to tighten it up to advance far in Miami, but this might be the match he needs to get started. Winner: Djokovic—Steve Tignor
